# AtmBitBit Extension for lnbits

This extension allows you to connect a AtmBitBit ATM to an lnbits wallet. It will work with both the [open-source DIY AtmBitBit ATM project](https://github.com/samotari/atmbitbit) as well as the [commercial AtmBitBit ATM](https://www.atmbitbit.com/).

## Connect Your AtmBitBit ATM

- Click the "Add AtmBitBit" button on this page to begin.
- Choose a wallet. This will be the wallet that is used to pay satoshis to your ATM customers.
- Choose the fiat currency. This should match the fiat currency that your ATM accepts.
- Pick an exchange rate provider. This is the API that will be used to query the fiat to satoshi exchange rate at the time your customer attempts to withdraw their funds.
- Set your ATM's fee percentage.
- Click the "Done" button.
- Find the new AtmBitBit in the list and then click the export icon to download a new configuration file for your ATM.
- Copy the configuration file ("atmbitbit.conf") to your ATM's SD card.
- Restart Your AtmBitBit ATM. It should automatically reload the configurations from the SD card.

## How Does It Work?

Since the AtmBitBit ATMs are designed to be offline, a cryptographic signing scheme is used to verify that the URL was generated by an authorized device. When one of your customers inserts fiat money into the device, a signed URL (lnurl-withdraw) is created and displayed as a QR code. Your customer scans the QR code with their lnurl-supporting mobile app, their mobile app communicates with the web API of lnbits to verify the signature, the fiat currency amount is converted to sats, the customer accepts the withdrawal, and finally lnbits will pay the customer from your lnbits wallet.
